## On hiatus

The performance issues and general just meh-ness of Atom recently have led me to
give VS Code a try, and it's real nice and I'm enjoying it. I might come back to
this theme in the future, but at least for now there won't be any further updates.

A classy dark syntax theme inspired by Tubster and all its variants.

Both `language-gfm` and `language-markdown` have been tuned for the best possible
appearance, however they will not look exactly the same.

Credit to whoever made Tubster in the first place.

- Supports CriticMarkup
- Text Decoration for markdown: **bold**, _italics_, ~~strikethrough~~
- Tuned to be contrast safe to the WCAG AA standard. This means better readability!
